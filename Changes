Changes for Perl extension Portable

0.05 Sun 27 Apr 2008
	- Don't preload the configurations.
	  (Delay until the final ->apply is called)
	- Import now takes backend names as params
	  (Allows appending "use Portable 'Config';" to Config.pm etc)
	- Adding tests for the new interfaces
	- Disable warnings when playing around with Config::STORE
	- Completing the implementation of Portable::CPAN
	- A variety of functionality bug fixes

0.04 Wed 23 Apr 2008
	- Separating out each task into a separate class
	- Making the overwriting of CPAN::Config optional, 
	  because (at least theoretically) it doesn't always exist

0.03 Tue 22 Apr 2008
	- Moving the name from Perl::Portable to Portable
	- Adding proper support for Portable'ing CPAN::Config
	- Removing dependency bloat, use only 5.10.1 core modules

0.02 Mon 21 Apr 2008
	- Completely changed the portable.perl format to be based on
	  Config.pm instead of some arbitrary format I invented myself.

0.01 Fri 18 Apr 2008
	- Experimental first release
